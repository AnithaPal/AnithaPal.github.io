I am a software developer in Atlanta, GA who enjoys building applications that present complex, unstructured data in sensible and intuitive fashion. I utilize my background in engineering, development testing, and passion for building web applications. I am looking for a position to apply my skills, learn and develop impactful applications.

When I am not coding, you can see me running behind my toddler - learning how to fine tune my tongue to an American ear, find patterns in activities and objects that I can also apply in programming and be persistent even when the world around you is in complete chaos.

**Technical Skills:** Ruby on Rails, Rspec, JavaScript, AngularJS, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Bootstrap, Grunt, Git, AWS, Heroku.
