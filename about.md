I am  a stay at home mom, in the journey of becoming a budding web developer, living in Alpharetta, GA. Currently, I am a student of Bloc.ioâ€™s Full Stack Development course, learning all the necessary skills to become a well rounded professional. I love to make things that touches people's life and keeps my right side of the brain active. 

When I am not coding, you can see me running behind my toddler and learning how to fine tune my tongue to an american ear, find patterns in activities and objects that I can also apply in programming and be persistent even the world around you is in complete chaos.
