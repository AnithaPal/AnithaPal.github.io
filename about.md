I am a stay at home mom, on the journey to becoming a budding web developer, living in Alpharetta, GA. Currently, I am a student of Bloc.ioâ€™s Full Stack Development course, learning the skills to become a well rounded professional. I am passionate about  developing products that touches people's lives. 

When I am not coding, you can see me running behind my toddler and  learning how to fine tune my tongue to an american ear, find patterns in activities and objects that I can also apply in programming and be persistent even when the world around you is in complete chaos.
